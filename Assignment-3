1. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the sales performance of its products in different regions. They have collected the following data:
   Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
   Calculate the mean sales for each region.
Ans:
    Mean for Region A = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5
    = 59 / 5
    = 11.8
    Mean for Region B = (18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25) / 5
    = 101 / 5
    = 20.2

    In summary:

    The mean sales for Region A is 11.8.
    The mean sales for Region B is 20.2.   

2. Scenario: A survey is conducted to measure customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5. The data collected is as follows:
   [4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]
   Calculate the mode of the survey responses.
Ans:   
   To find the mode, let's count the frequency of each response:

   2 appears twice
   3 appears twice
   4 appears three times
   5 appears three times
   Both 4 and 5 have the highest frequency, occurring three times each. Therefore, the mode of the survey responses is 4 and 5.


3. Scenario: A company wants to compare the salaries of two departments. The salary data for Department A and Department B are as follows:
   Department A: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]
   Department B: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]
   Calculate the median salary for each department.
Ans:
    Department A:
    Salary data: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]

    Arranging the data in ascending order: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]

    Since there are four data points, the median will be the average of the two middle values:

    Median for Department A = (5500 + 6000) / 2
    = 11500 / 2
    = 5750

    Therefore, the median salary for Department A is 5750.

    Department B:
    Salary data: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]

    Arranging the data in ascending order: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]

    Since there are five data points, the median will be the middle value:

    Median for Department B = 5500

    Therefore, the median salary for Department B is 5500.

    In summary:

    The median salary for Department A is 5750.
    The median salary for Department B is 5500.
4.6. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. The data collected is as follows:
   Advertising Expenditure (in thousands): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Sales (in thousands): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]
   Calculate the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales.
Ans:
   Step 1: Calculate the means of both variables.
      Mean of Advertising Expenditure = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5
      = 59 / 5
      = 11.8
      
      Mean of Sales = (25 + 30 + 28 + 20 + 26) / 5
      = 129 / 5
      = 25.8
   Step 2: Calculate the deviations from the means for both variables.  
      Deviation of Advertising Expenditure = [10 - 11.8, 15 - 11.8, 12 - 11.8, 8 - 11.8, 14 - 11.8]
      = [-1.8, 3.2, 0.2, -3.8, 2.2]
      
      Deviation of Sales = [25 - 25.8, 30 - 25.8, 28 - 25.8, 20 - 25.8, 26 - 25.8]
      = [-0.8, 4.2, 2.2, -5.8, 0.2]
      
   Step 3: Calculate the product of the deviations for each pair of data points.
      Product of Deviations = [-1.8 * -0.8, 3.2 * 4.2, 0.2 * 2.2, -3.8 * -5.8, 2.2 * 0.2]
      = [1.44, 13.44, 0.44, 22.04, 0.44]
   Step 4: Calculate the sums of the squared deviations for each variable.
   
      Sum of Squared Deviations of Advertising Expenditure = (-1.8)^2 + (3.2)^2 + (0.2)^2 + (-3.8)^2 + (2.2)^2
      = 3.24 + 10.24 + 0.04 + 14.44 + 4.84
      = 32.8
      
      Sum of Squared Deviations of Sales = (-0.8)^2 + (4.2)^2 + (2.2)^2 + (-5.8)^2 + (0.2)^2
      = 0.64 + 17.64 + 4.84 + 33.64 + 0.04
      = 57.8
   Step 5: Calculate the square roots of the sums of squared deviations.
   
   Square Root of Sum of Squared Deviations of Advertising Expenditure = sqrt(32.8) = 5.73
   Square Root of Sum of Squared Deviations of Sales = sqrt(57.8) = 7.61
   
   Step 6: Calculate the sum of the product of deviations.
   
   Sum of Product of Deviations = 1.44 + 13.44 + 0.44 + 22.04 + 0.44
   = 37.8
   
   Step 7: Calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r).
   
   r = (Sum of Product of Deviations) / (Square Root of Sum of Squared Deviations of Advertising Expenditure * Square Root of Sum of Squared Deviations of Sales)
   = 37.8 / (5.73 * 7.61)
   = 37.8 / 43.57
   = 0.87 (rounded to two decimal places)

   Therefore, the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales is 0.87, indicating a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables.
5.7. Scenario: A survey is conducted to measure the heights of a group of people. The data collected is as follows:
   [160, 170, 165, 155, 175, 180, 170]
   Calculate the standard deviation of the heights.
Ans:
   Step 1: Calculate the mean of the heights.
   
   Mean = (160 + 170 + 165 + 155 + 175 + 180 + 170) / 7
   = 1175 / 7
   = 167.86 (rounded to two decimal places)
   
   Step 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean for each height.
   
   Deviations = [(160 - 167.86), (170 - 167.86), (165 - 167.86), (155 - 167.86), (175 - 167.86), (180 - 167.86), (170 - 167.86)]
   = [-7.86, 2.14, -2.86, -12.86, 7.14, 12.14, 2.14]
   
   Step 3: Square each deviation.
   
   Squared Deviations = [(-7.86)^2, (2.14)^2, (-2.86)^2, (-12.86)^2, (7.14)^2, (12.14)^2, (2.14)^2]
   = [61.7, 4.58, 8.19, 165.14, 51.08, 147.63, 4.58]

   Step 4: Calculate the mean of the squared deviations.

   Mean of Squared Deviations = (61.7 + 4.58 + 8.19 + 165.14 + 51.08 + 147.63 + 4.58) / 7
   = 442.9 / 7
   = 63.27 (rounded to two decimal places)
   
   Step 5: Calculate the square root of the mean of squared deviations.
   
   Standard Deviation = sqrt(63.27)
   = 7.95 (rounded to two decimal places)
   
   Therefore, the standard deviation of the heights [160, 170, 165, 155, 175, 180, 170] is approximately 7.95.
