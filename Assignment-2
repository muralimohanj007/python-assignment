1. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the sales performance of its products in different regions. They have collected the following data:
   Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
   Calculate the mean sales for each region.
Ans:
    Mean for Region A = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5
    = 59 / 5
    = 11.8
    Mean for Region B = (18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25) / 5
    = 101 / 5
    = 20.2

    In summary:

    The mean sales for Region A is 11.8.
    The mean sales for Region B is 20.2.   

2. Scenario: A survey is conducted to measure customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5. The data collected is as follows:
   [4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]
   Calculate the mode of the survey responses.
Ans:   
To find the mode, let's count the frequency of each response:

2 appears twice
3 appears twice
4 appears three times
5 appears three times
Both 4 and 5 have the highest frequency, occurring three times each. Therefore, the mode of the survey responses is 4 and 5.


3. Scenario: A company wants to compare the salaries of two departments. The salary data for Department A and Department B are as follows:
   Department A: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]
   Department B: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]
   Calculate the median salary for each department.
Ans:
    Department A:
    Salary data: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]

    Arranging the data in ascending order: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]

    Since there are four data points, the median will be the average of the two middle values:

    Median for Department A = (5500 + 6000) / 2
    = 11500 / 2
    = 5750

    Therefore, the median salary for Department A is 5750.

    Department B:
    Salary data: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]

    Arranging the data in ascending order: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]

    Since there are five data points, the median will be the middle value:

    Median for Department B = 5500

    Therefore, the median salary for Department B is 5500.

    In summary:

    The median salary for Department A is 5750.
    The median salary for Department B is 5500.
